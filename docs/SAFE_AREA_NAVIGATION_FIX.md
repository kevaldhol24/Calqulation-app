# Safe Area Navigation Fix

## Problem
When minimizing the app and restoring it from recent apps, the navigation bar would move behind the device's navigation buttons, making it inaccessible.

## Solution
This fix addresses the issue through several key changes:

### 1. Enhanced Safe Area Handling
- Added `SafeAreaWrapper` component that properly handles app state changes
- Ensures safe area insets are recalculated when the app becomes active
- Uses `react-native-safe-area-context` for proper safe area management

### 2. Navigation Bar Improvements
- Updated tab bar configuration to use dynamic safe area insets
- Added proper bottom padding based on device's safe area
- Implemented app state listener to refresh navigation on app focus

### 3. Configuration Updates
- Removed `edgeToEdgeEnabled` from Android configuration
- Added proper `androidStatusBar` configuration
- Configured `softwareKeyboardLayoutMode` for better keyboard handling

### 4. App State Management
- Created `useAppState` hook to monitor app state changes
- Implemented refresh mechanism when app becomes active
- Added key-based re-rendering for NavigationContainer

## Files Modified

### Core Components
- `App.tsx`: Updated to use SafeAreaWrapper
- `navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`: Enhanced with safe area handling
- `components/SafeAreaWrapper.tsx`: New component for robust safe area management

### Configuration
- `app.json`: Updated Android configuration for proper safe area handling

### Utilities
- `hooks/useAppState.ts`: New hook for app state monitoring

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. Navigation bar stays above device navigation buttons
2. Safe area is properly recalculated on app resume
3. No visual glitches occur during app state transitions
4. Works consistently across different Android devices

## Technical Details
The solution uses a combination of:
- React Native Safe Area Context for proper inset calculations
- App State API for detecting app lifecycle changes
- Dynamic padding adjustments based on device safe area
- Key-based re-rendering to force safe area recalculation
