# Build Optimization Checklist

## 🎯 Pre-Build Optimization

### ✅ Dependencies Optimization
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies from `package.json`
- [ ] Use exact versions to ensure consistent builds
- [ ] Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives
- [ ] Use tree-shaking compatible libraries

### ✅ Asset Optimization
- [ ] Compress images using tools like TinyPNG
- [ ] Use WebP format for images where possible
- [ ] Remove unused assets from `assets/` folder
- [ ] Use vector graphics (SVG) for icons instead of raster images
- [ ] Optimize splash screen and icon sizes

### ✅ Code Optimization
- [ ] Remove console.log statements (automated in production)
- [ ] Remove unused imports and code
- [ ] Use React.memo for expensive components
- [ ] Implement lazy loading for screens
- [ ] Minimize inline styles

## 🏗 Build Configuration

### ✅ Metro Configuration
- [x] Tree shaking enabled
- [x] Asset optimization enabled
- [x] Console removal in production
- [x] Source map optimization

### ✅ Babel Configuration
- [x] Remove console statements in production
- [x] Remove debugger statements
- [x] Module resolver for cleaner imports

### ✅ EAS Configuration
- [x] ProGuard enabled for Android
- [x] Resource shrinking enabled
- [x] Optimized Gradle commands
- [x] Production environment variables

## 📱 Platform-Specific Optimizations

### Android
- [x] ProGuard obfuscation enabled
- [x] Resource shrinking enabled
- [x] APK vs AAB optimization
- [ ] Consider using R8 instead of ProGuard (advanced)

### General
- [x] Asset bundle patterns optimized
- [x] Permissions minimized
- [x] Build type configuration

## 🚀 GitHub Actions Optimizations

### ✅ Build Performance
- [x] Dependency caching
- [x] Gradle caching
- [x] Node modules caching
- [x] Parallel job execution

### ✅ Artifact Management
- [x] Appropriate retention periods
- [x] Compressed artifacts
- [x] Clear naming conventions

## 📊 Monitoring & Analysis

### ✅ Bundle Analysis
- [x] Bundle size reporting
- [x] Asset map generation
- [x] Large file identification
- [ ] Performance monitoring setup

## 🔍 Regular Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Update dependencies to latest stable versions
- [ ] Review and remove unused packages
- [ ] Analyze bundle size trends
- [ ] Test build performance

### Release Tasks
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Create release notes
- [ ] Test on multiple devices
- [ ] Verify app functionality

## 📈 Expected Improvements

With these optimizations, you should see:

- **Build Time**: 30-50% faster builds
- **Bundle Size**: 20-40% smaller APK/AAB
- **App Performance**: Faster startup and navigation
- **Reliability**: More consistent builds with fewer failures

## 🛠 Advanced Optimizations (Optional)

### For Large Apps
- [ ] Code splitting by route
- [ ] Dynamic imports for heavy components
- [ ] Asset lazy loading
- [ ] Bundle splitting strategies

### For Teams
- [ ] Shared build caches
- [ ] Build failure notifications
- [ ] Automated testing integration
- [ ] Release automation

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't optimize prematurely - measure first
- Always test optimized builds on real devices
- Keep source maps for debugging in development
- Don't remove error logging entirely
- Backup working configurations before major changes
